Connecting Spring Boot Application with DB

1. The Spring Boot app uses the artifacts provided by the spring 
    spring-boot-starter-web
    spring-boot-starter-data-jpa

  It helps to start the REST Service which is exposed via http://{hostname}/hospital 

2. For DB connection with MySql we have used the artifact mysql-connector-java
